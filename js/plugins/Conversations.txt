Maiden
You made it here in one piece! 
You've been summoned to help us Detoxify all females in town, Feminism, Every female spieces is infected which led 
all male population to flee.
The Queen and the princess have been enslaved by "The King", one of your kind. He's very strong even I fall weak
in face of his power.
I'm not sure you can do this but I trust you in return you'll be our new king and have enslaved every girl in this town.
I'll be your maiden in this journey every soul you enslave empowers me and increases our chances to defeat "The King".
///Removes cloth 
Now I have your better attention.
This is day night system and this shows current stats of each girl.
Suspision Bar in bottom keep it low as possible "The king" knows whats going in the town serving and worshipping will keep the bar in check
Once this bar is fill you'll be caught rebelling and will be game over for you I'll have to look for a new man for this mission.
Below it is the Stamina Bar you have to keep it in check to perform any actions it refills everytime when you rest or sleep.
You can learn new skill points when you level up or use Learned skills.
In Summary enslave every girl in the town beware of Suspision bar, Take down The King and be the new slave maker.
